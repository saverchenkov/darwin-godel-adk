LearningAgent initiating root cause analysis...

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The execution summary indicates that no planner output or agent specification was provided.  This is the root cause of the system's failure to modify and validate system agents. The PlannerAgent completed its planning phase, suggesting the issue lies in the communication or execution pathway between the PlannerAgent and the ExecutorAgent.  The ExecutorAgent likely lacks the necessary information (agent specification, actions, etc.) to proceed.


**2. Key Learnings:**

*   **Communication Breakdown:** There's a critical gap in communication between the PlannerAgent and the ExecutorAgent.  The PlannerAgent produces a plan, but this plan isn't effectively transmitted or interpreted by the ExecutorAgent.
*   **Missing Agent Specification:** The ExecutorAgent requires a clear specification of which agents to modify and how.  The PlannerAgent's output needs to include this information in a structured format.
*   **Need for Robust Error Handling:** The system lacks robust error handling.  The absence of a detailed failure log highlights this deficiency.  Future iterations should incorporate detailed logging and error reporting mechanisms.


**3. Optimize `knowledge.md`:**

The current `knowledge.md` is empty.  The updated version will include the findings from this analysis.


**4. Capability Gap Report for ArchitectAgent:**

**Capability Gap Report**

**System:**  Agent-based system for system modification and validation.

**Gap:** The current system lacks a robust mechanism for transferring structured plans from the PlannerAgent to the ExecutorAgent.  There is no defined format for agent specifications. Error handling and logging are insufficient.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Develop a standardized format:** Define a clear, structured format for representing agent specifications and action plans. This format should be easily parsable by both the PlannerAgent and the ExecutorAgent.  Consider using JSON or YAML.
*   **Implement robust communication:**  Develop a reliable mechanism for data exchange between agents.  This could involve using a message queue or a shared data store.
*   **Enhance error handling and logging:**  Implement detailed logging to capture errors and facilitate debugging.  The logging system should provide sufficient information to pinpoint the source of failures.
*   **Develop a monitoring system:**  Implement a monitoring system to track agent performance and identify potential issues proactively.


**5. Generate `knowledge.md` Update using `_write_file_impl`:**

```python
updated_knowledge = '''# System Learnings

## Execution Analysis - {{ execution_id }}

**Root Cause:** Lack of planner output or agent specification provided to the ExecutorAgent.  The PlannerAgent completed planning, suggesting a communication or data transfer issue between the PlannerAgent and the ExecutorAgent.

**Key Learnings:**

* Communication Breakdown: Ineffective transfer of the plan from PlannerAgent to ExecutorAgent.
* Missing Agent Specification: ExecutorAgent requires a structured agent specification for modification instructions.
* Insufficient Error Handling:  The system lacks robust error handling and detailed logging.

**Capability Gaps (ArchitectAgent):**

*   **Missing Standardized Plan Format:**  A structured format (e.g., JSON, YAML) is needed for agent specifications and action plans.
*   **Unreliable Agent Communication:**  A robust mechanism (e.g., message queue, shared data store) is required for reliable data exchange between agents.
*   **Lack of Detailed Error Handling and Logging:** Implementation of detailed logging and error handling is crucial.
*   **Absence of Monitoring System:**  A proactive monitoring system to track agent performance and identify issues is needed.


**Actions Taken:**  Root cause analysis performed, capability gaps identified, and knowledge base updated.  Recommendations for architectural improvements provided to ArchitectAgent.
